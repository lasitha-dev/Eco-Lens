## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- [ ] Save card details for faster checkout (with PCI compliance)
- [ ] Add more payment methods (PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay)
- [ ] Implement 3D Secure authentication
- [ ] Add billing address (separate from shipping)
- [ ] Support multiple currencies
- [ ] Add coupon/promo code support
- [ ] Implement saved addresses
- [ ] Add payment method selection (multiple saved cards)

### Production Deployment

For production, update the backend to use **real Stripe Payment Intents**:

```javascript
// Replace simulated payment with real Stripe API
const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
  amount: Math.round(cart.totalAmount * 100),
  currency: 'usd',
  payment_method_types: ['card'],
  payment_method_data: {
    type: 'card',
    card: {
      number: paymentDetails.cardNumber,
      exp_month: parseInt(paymentDetails.expiryDate.split('/')[0]),
      exp_year: parseInt(`20${paymentDetails.expiryDate.split('/')[1]}`),
      cvc: paymentDetails.cvv,
    },
  },
  confirm: true,
});
```

**Note**: This requires proper PCI compliance and Stripe setup.

- ✅ **Better UX**: No context switching to browser
- ✅ **Native feel**: Fully integrated with app design
