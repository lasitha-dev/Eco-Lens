## What Was Wrong?

The backend was querying the Order collection with field names that don't exist:
- `userId` (doesn't exist) → should be `user`
- `status: 'completed'` (doesn't exist) → should be `paymentStatus: 'paid'`

This caused:
- ❌ Zero orders found in all queries
- ❌ Progress always 0%
- ❌ No purchases tracked
- ❌ Empty recent activity

---

## Next Steps

1. **Restart the backend server** to apply changes

2. **Test the flow:**
   - Create a new sustainability goal
   - Make a purchase with products
   - Check goal progress updates

3. **Expected backend logs:**
   ```
   🎯 Tracking purchase for sustainability goals - User: xxx, Order: yyy
   📊 Processing X items against Y goals
   ✅ Updated goal "Goal Name": X/Y purchases (XX.X%)
   🎉 Successfully tracked purchase against Y goals
   ```

4. **Expected app behavior:**
   - ✅ Goals show as "active" (1 active instead of 0 active)
   - ✅ Progress percentage updates correctly
   - ✅ Recent Activity shows purchased products
   - ✅ Profile stats display accurate numbers
