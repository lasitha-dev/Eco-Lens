## 🚀 Technical Implementation

### State Management
- Uses React hooks for form state and real-time calculations
- Efficient re-rendering with proper dependency arrays
- Local state management for dashboard data

### Data Structure
Products follow this structure:
```javascript
{
  id: string,
  name: string,
  description: string,
  price: number,
  category: string,
  stock: number,
  image: string,
  seller: {
    name: string,
    certifications: string[]
  },
  ecoMetrics: {
    materialsScore: number,
    carbonFootprint: number,
    packagingType: string,
    manufacturingProcess: string,
    productLifespan: number,
    recyclablePercentage: number,
    biodegradablePercentage: number
  },
  sustainabilityScore: number,
  sustainabilityGrade: string,
  rating: number,
  reviewCount: number
}
```

### Navigation Integration
- Added to AppNavigator.js
- Accessible from HomeScreen
- Modal-based product form for better UX

## 🔧 Customization Options

### Adding New Categories
Update the `CATEGORIES` array in `ProductForm.js`:
```javascript
const CATEGORIES = [
  'Electronics',
  'Fashion',
  // Add new categories here
];
```

### Modifying Scoring Weights
Adjust weights in `SustainabilityCalculator.js`:
```javascript
const SCORE_WEIGHTS = {
  materialsScore: 0.25,        // Adjust percentages
  carbonFootprint: 0.20,       // (must sum to 1.0)
  // ... other weights
};
```

### Theme Customization
Modify colors and styling in `theme.js`:
```javascript
export const colors = {
  primary: '#4CAF50',          // Change primary color
  gradeA: '#4CAF50',          // Modify grade colors
  // ... other colors
};
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Images not loading**: Verify image URLs are valid and accessible
2. **Score not updating**: Check that all eco-metrics are valid numbers
3. **Form validation errors**: Ensure all required fields are filled correctly

### Performance Considerations
- Product list is optimized with FlatList for large datasets
- Real-time scoring is debounced to prevent excessive calculations
- Images are loaded lazily to improve performance

## 🔄 Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions

- **Analytics Dashboard**: Detailed sustainability analytics
- **Product Categories Management**: Admin category management
- **User Permissions**: Role-based access control
- **Export Functionality**: Export product data to various formats
