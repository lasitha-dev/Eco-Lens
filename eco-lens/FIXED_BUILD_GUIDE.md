# ✅ Build Issues Fixed - Complete Guide

## What Was Fixed:
1. ✅ Removed unused React Navigation dependencies causing build failures
2. ✅ Added Android package configuration: `com.ecolens.app`
3. ✅ Created placeholder icons for the build
4. ✅ Updated app.json with proper configuration

## OPTION 1: Test with Expo Go (FASTEST - 2 minutes)

Your app is already running! Just:

1. **Install Expo Go** on your Android phone:
   - Open Play Store
   - Search "Expo Go"
   - Install it

2. **Open Expo Go** and scan QR code:
   - Look at your terminal where `npm start` is running
   - You'll see a QR code
   - In Expo Go, tap "Scan QR code"
   - Point camera at the QR code
   - App loads instantly!

## OPTION 2: Build APK with EAS (15-20 minutes)
